In anticipation of the re-designation of CIT and ITT as the Munster Technological University, MTU, a new travel services company, “MTU Travel” is to be created. Cork Institute of Technology, as sponsor, wishes to create a web page for this new entity but is unsure of the specification so wishes to have it developed in stages. Create an initial web page and subsequently update it in stages, using git to manage the changes. (a) Create a very basic HTML home page document for CIT Travel Services. The page only contains the name “CIT Travel Services” and its address. Create a git repository and commit the initial version of the page. (b) Add items to the web page. Create and commit 5 variations, each time committing to the repository. (c) Add a second file to the repository e.g. a css file to change the look of the page and commit that css file also with two revisions of the css file. Additionally, revise the html code to use the css file. Thus, there are now 7 versions of the web page. (d) Demonstrate rolling back to version 4.  Branch version 6 into a new web page to demonstrate a new variation for the customer.  (e) Demonstrate merging, versioning and stashing.
